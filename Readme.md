# REST API

## What makes API Restful

1. REST Architectural design pattern to design the APIs.
2. Principles
   1. Client Server Architecture
   2. Stateless
   3. Cacheable
   4. Layered
      1. System can be split into layers
      2. Layers could be Load Balancers, Webservers, Firewall, Database
   5. Uniform Interface
      1. Their should be uniform communication to access the resource
      2. Their should be unique urls

## Naming Conventions

1. only lower case letters
2. "-" to separate multiple orders
3. Variables should be camelCase (query and path parameters)
4. Hierarchical relationships using forward slashes
5. Should use Nouns for resources
6. Use query parameter for filtering
7. No trailing slashes at end

## Rest best practices

1. KISS (Keep it simple stupid)
2. Versioning
3. Caching
4. Rate Limiting

## Access Control

1. Using Roles and privileges
2. Role is a collection of privileges
3. Privilege is a authority to do certain task
